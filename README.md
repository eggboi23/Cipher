# Cipher
This project is a cipher encoder and decrypter

Given some string, you can encode or decrypt it using a caesar or subsitution cipher

Perfect if you want to make a super secure password...

# How to Use
You can run this using a makefile!

Simply write into the terminal: `make run_ciphers`

Then, it will prompt you with the menu:

------------

C - Encrypt with Caesar Cipher

D - Decrypt Caesar Cipher

E - Compute English-ness Score

A - Apply Random Substitution Cipher

S - Decrypt Substitution Cipher from Console

F - Decrypt Substitution Cipher from File

R - Set Random Seed for Testing

X - Exit Program

------------

Write the letter of what you want to do in the terminal, press enter and follow the corresponding prompts

Once you are done, you can type in `X` and exit the program!
